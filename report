## Data
The data used is sourced from a Kaggle dataset that pulled Spotify data for music from Taylor Swift. The data was cleaned in Python to exclude duplicates, karaoke versions, and radio specials. Then, as several albums are available in multiple versions, like deluxe or platnium editions, a new column called "era" was used to group unique songs. Song names were normalized to group them together, cutting off labels such as "acoustic version" or "ft. Lana Del Ray", and removing capital letters to account for re-releases with different punctuation. Then average metrics were used to aggregate the data across albums with multiple version. 

Description of attributes, provided by Spotify: 
* accousticness: confidence measure from 0-1 determining if a song is acoustic. 1.0 is high confidence and 0 is very low confidence 
* danceability: determines how danceable a song is based on musical elements like tempo, rhytm stability, beat strength, and regularity. 0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. 
* duration_ms: shows the length of the song in milliseconds 
* energy: represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity, quantifying how fast, loud, or noisy a track is, 0.0 to 1.0, with 1 being most energetic.
